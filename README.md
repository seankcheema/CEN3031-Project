{Project Sprint 0: Setup}

Project Name: QuestList

Project Description: This will be a website designed to be a database and community. It will take inspiration from the popular forum/database website titled MyAnimeList. Our goal is to create a place where people of similar interests can come together to keep track of, rank, and share games they have played and enjoyed. The website will update with a list of all documented games from a database and allow users to share their personal rankings, comments, playtime, and any critiques of the game. Users will also be able to access the same data shared by the community and connect with other users to compare thoughts and statistics. We plan to use an existing database of games (such as igdb.com) to extract metadata about the games. Our first priority will be to establish a working database and ensure that we can extrapolate data from it. Additionally, we will focus on communication between front end and back end to make sure both sides stay on track.
